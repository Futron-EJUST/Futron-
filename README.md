## Welcome to FUTRON Club

**We hope you enjoy throughout the joureny**

### Mission

Futron is dedicated to giving its members an insight about the ongoing advances in the fields of
electronics and communication. This will be done by informative sessions and seminars on topics
covering the future trends of the mentioned fields. The sessions will also be followed by workshops
that allow the members to experience applying the knowledge they acquired in the sessions.

### Activities 

1. Weekly sessions aimed at tackling a new concept of electronics and communication
or providing a needed base for it.

2. Weekly workshop sessions to provide an environment for application and working
on projects.

3. Forming groups participants with the aim of applying the information provided in
the form of projects and promoting the value of teamwork.

4. Guiding the mentioned groups to make a prototype for a complete advanced system
by the end of the semester.

### Summer Campaign

With cordination with [Robotics club](URL), we are launching several courses: 
1. At this campaign, we will provide the students with unique courses that are considered as basics to help members get involved into robotics field. Those courses are selected so that they donâ€™t conflict or repeat fuclty courses, and concentrarte at practical aspects.
2. This campaign is necessary for students and members to be able to hold and participate in upcoming activities and workshops. Those activities and workshops are to be held (on campus) by the start of the next semester (fall 2020) to implement what the students have learned throughout the campaign.
